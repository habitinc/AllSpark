Allspark

[API Documentation](http://habitinc.github.io/AllSpark/)


AllSpark is a base class for WordPress plugins built by Habit. It's designed to simplify plugin development by automating common tasks, and defining some simple conventions. Features include:

* Automatic handling of common actions and hooks - subclasses use the Inversion of Control pattern to handle hooks as functions
* Automatic registration of activation and deactivation hooks
* Enable a settings link from the plugins page in one line of code
* Including UI elements in a way that enforces a separation of concerns
* Simplifies listening for AJAX actions

## Installation

It's easiest to add this base class to your plugin via a git submodule (at least until it hits 1.0!) so it's easy to update often. 

## Changelog
